# 2025

Monorepo for my 2025 projects.

## ⭐ Highlights

### [browser-verifier](./browser-verifier)
A full-stack in-browser ZK proof verifier. Uses R0VM for ZK proving, compiled to WebAssembly via `wasm-pack`, served through a Next.js app. Verifies a proof of the 1,000,000th Fibonacci number directly in the browser — in a fraction of the time it takes to calculate it directly. Includes a [video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTCPCf8ff-c).

### [cubes](./cubes)
An interactive personal site built with SvelteKit and Three.js. Navigate a rolling cube across an 8×8 chess-style grid using arrow keys — land on highlighted tiles to reveal content like blog posts and reading lists. Smooth roll animations with pivot-point physics and eased quaternion interpolation.
